# custconsole

## A CLI-development package created by Jordan Chesley.

This is a project I came up with while learning about Python decorators a couple years ago. I deleted the project due to some embarrasing "features" I made (what a child I was). After maturing and refining the project, I decided to republish this project.

Note that this is a hobby project. While it is a usable package, it most likely won't be consistently maintained.
